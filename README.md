[![License](https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/napari-feature-classifier.svg?color=green)](https://github.com/fractal-napari-plugins-collection/napari_feature_classifier/raw/main/LICENSE)

An interactive classifier plugin that allows the user to assign objects in a label image to multiple classes and train a classifier to learn those classes based on a feature dataframe.

## Installation

This plugin is written for the new napari npe2 plugin engine. Thus, it requires napari >= 0.4.13
Download the repository and manually install it (not on pypi / the napari plugin hub yet)

    git clone https://github.com/fractal-napari-plugins-collection/napari-feature-classifier
    cd napari-feature-classifier
    pip install .



## Usage
#### Initialize a classifier:
- Start the classifier in napari by going to Plugins -> napari-feature-classifier -> Initialize a Classifier  
- Provide a csv file that contains feature measurements and a column with the integer labels corresponding to the label layer you are using.
- Choose a name (or relative path from the current working directory) for the classifier. The classifier is always saved in the current working directory (or the relative path to it you chose as its name. Renaming a classifier isn't currently possible (you can rename the file, but if you save it again, it will be saved as its original name)
- Select the features you want to use for the classifier (can't be changed later in the current implementation). Hold the command key to select multiple features

#### Classify objects:
- Make sure you have the label layer selected on which you want to classify
- Select the current class with the radio buttons or by pressing 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4
- Click on label objects in the viewer to assign them to the currently selected class
- Once you have trained enough examples, click "Run Classifier" to run the classifier and have it make a prediction for all objects. Aim for at least a dozen annotations per class, as the classifier divides your annotations 80/20 in training and test sets. To get good performance readouts, aim for >30 annotations per class.

#### Apply the classifier to additional images:
- You can apply a classifier trained on one image to additional label images. Use Plugins -> napari-feature-classifier -> Load Classifier  
- Select the classifier (.clf file with the name you gave above) and a dataframe containing the same features as the past images.
- Click Load Classifier, proceed as above.

#### Export classifier results
- To export the training data and the results of the classifier, define an Export Name (full path to an output file or just a filename ending in .csv) where the results of the classifier shall be saved
- Click "Export Classifier Result"
- The results of the classifier are save in a csv file. The first two columns are index columns: path describes the Feature Path used (and allows you to understand which image / feature dataframe a result is from) and label is an integer of the label object within that image. The predict column contains predictions of the classifier for all objects (except those that contained NaNs in their feature data) and the train column contains the annotations you made (0 for unclassified objects, 1, 2, 3 or 4 for the classes)
